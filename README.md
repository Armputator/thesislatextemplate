## GENERAL

This is a LaTex document template, specifically targeted towards
student of the university of applied sciences Munich (Hochschule MÃ¼nchen)

To compile this you will have to run a latex compiler (like pdflatex) once at the beginning
and once at the end, after your extra compilers have done their stuff.
This extra stuff needs to be at least once makeglossaries. Additionally run
bibtex if you wanna use .bib sources.

Subfiles structure allows you to compile one of the single tex files other than
the main individually. For this only run a latex compiler once, as extras like makeglossaries
and bibtex will not work without the latex code in "main.tex".

For example i generated my pdf by running pdflatex, makeglossaries, pdflatex
